## :wave: Welcome to my project repository!

🎓My name is Ioannis. I'm currently an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's in electrical engineering. I've been into electronics and science for some time and since high school I've been doing various projects as a hobby. This repository is a place to document my attempts at trying new stuff, and sometimes, completed projects.

⚡My main interests are:
- high voltage circuits
- power electronics
- IoT and embedded systems
- new and emerging technology

🚀You will find primarily projects in those categories and some extra stuff sprinkled in between.
