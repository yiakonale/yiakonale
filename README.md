## :wave: Welcome to my project repository!

ðŸŽ“My name is Ioannis. I'm currently an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's in electrical engineering. I've been into electronics and science for some time now and since high school I've been doing various projects as a hobby. This repository is a place to document my attempts at trying new stuff, and sometimes, completed projects.

âš¡My main interests are:
- high voltage circuits
- power electronics
- IoT and embedded systems

ðŸš€You will primarily find projects that belong to those categories as well as some extra stuff sprinkled in between.

* Currently __working__ on: `High-speed photography unit`
